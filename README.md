# Why?

Umm. No good reason to use this. Have fun with it though :_)

# How to use?

Create a `.env` file and put in your openapi key as follows:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=######
```

Then simply run 
`npm install`

Then run
`npm run dev`

# How to edit?

Just edit the `index.html` file. When ever you want raw js to be generated use the ai="" data attribute on an html element.
